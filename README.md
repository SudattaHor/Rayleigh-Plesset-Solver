# Solver for General Rayleigh-Plesset Equation

## Setup

Consider a single bubble in an infinite domain of liquid.

- Liquid density is constant (although compressibility is important).
- Liquid is at rest at a distance far from the bubble.
- Liquid temperature is uniform at a distance far from the bubble.
- Liquid's dynamic viscosity is constant and uniform.
- Bubble contents are homogenous and its temperature and pressure are uniform.
