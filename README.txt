Solver for general Rayleigh-Plesset equation.

Setup: A single bubble in an infinite domain of liquid.

Assumptions:
	- Liquid density is constant (although compressibility is important)
	- Liquid is at rest at a distance far from the bubble
	- Liquid temperature is uniform at a distance far from the bubble
	- Liquid's dynamic viscosity is constant and uniform
Bubble contents are homogenous and its temperature and pressure are uniform
