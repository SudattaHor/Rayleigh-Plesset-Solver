# Description of Figures

p_inf is the pressure at infinity.
p_atm is the atmospheric pressure.

## Figure 1

p_inf = p_atm

## Figure 2

p_inf = 2*p_atm

## Figure 3

p_inf = 0.5*p_atm

## Figure 4

p_inf = 2*p_atm

Kinematic viscosity is set to be high, around 1e-1

## Figure 5

p_inf = 10*p_atm

We start to see inertial collapse
