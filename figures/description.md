# Description of Figures

p_inf is the pressure at infinity.
p_atm is the atmospheric pressure.

## Figure 1

p_inf = p_atm

## Figure 2

p_inf = 2*p_atm

## Figure 3

p_inf = 0.5*p_atm

## Figure 4

p_inf = 2*p_atm

Kinematic viscosity is set to be high, around 1e-1

## Figure 5

p_inf = 10*p_atm

We start to see inertial collapse. t/t_c is the dimensionless time where t_c 
is the time for cavitation given by

<!-- $$
t_c = 0.915\left(\frac{\rho_L R_0^2}{p_inf}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
$$ --> 

<div align="center"><img style="background: white;" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?t_c%20%3D%200.915%5Cleft(%5Cfrac%7B%5Crho_L%20R_0%5E2%7D%7Bp_inf%7D%5Cright)%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D%0D"></div>

This becomes more accurate in figure 6.

## Figure 6

p_inf = 100*p_atm
